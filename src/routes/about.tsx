                NEXA GLOBAL MART is being built to bring shopping, sellers,
                suppliers and business opportunities together in one
                marketplace environment. We want to serve individuals,
                families, everyday shoppers, small businesses, retailers,
                wholesalers and buyers interested in international trade.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our purpose goes beyond listing products. We want to explore
                ways for people and businesses to participate in commerce,
                discover useful services and build connections that can create
                new possibilities.

              <p>
                We recognise that people have different needs and budgets.
                Our guiding ambition is to make the marketplace useful to
                people across different income levels, without suggesting
                that a person's worth or potential depends on how much money
                they have.
